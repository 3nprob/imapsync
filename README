DESCRIPTION
    The command imapsync is a tool allowing incremental and recursive imap
    transfer from one mailbox to another.

    We sometimes need to transfer mailboxes from one imap server to another.
    This is called migration.

    imapsync is the adequate tool because it reduces the amount of data
    transfered by not transfering a given message if it is already on both
    sides. All flags are preserved, unread will stay unread, read will stay
    read, deleted will stay deleted. You can stop the transfert at any time
    and restart it later, imapsync is adapted to a bad connection.

    You can decide to delete the messages from the source mailbox after a
    successful transfert (it is a good feature when migrating). In that
    case, use the --delete option, and run imapsync again with the --expunge
    option.

    You can also just synchronize a mailbox A from another mailbox B in case
    you just want to keep a "live" copy of B in A.

OPTIONS
    Invoke: imapsync --help

HISTORY
    I wrote imapsync because an enterprise (basystemes) paid me to install a
    new imap server without loosing huge old mailboxes located on a far away
    remote imap server accessible by a low bandwith link. The tool imapcp
    (written in python) could not help me because I had to verify every
    mailbox was well transfered and delete it after a good transfert.
    imapsync started its life being a copy_folder.pl patch. The tool
    copy_folder.pl comes from the Mail-IMAPClient-2.1.3 perl module tarball
    source (in the examples/ directory of the tarball).

EXAMPLES
    While working on imapsync parameters please run imapsync in dry mode (no
    modification induced) with the --dry option. Nothing bad can be done
    this way.

    To synchronize the imap account "buddy" on host "imap.src.fr" to the
    imap account "max" on host "imap.dest.fr" (the passwords are located in
    too files "/etc/secret1" for "buddy", "/etc/secret2" for "max") :

     imapsync --host1 imap.src.fr  --user1 buddy --passfile1 /etc/secret1 \
              --host2 imap.dest.fr --user2 max   --passfile2 /etc/secret2

    Then, you will have buddy's mailbox updated from max's mailbox.

SECURITY
    You can use --password1 instead of --passfile1 to give the password but
    it is dangerous because any user on your host can see the password by
    using the 'ps auxwwww' command. Using a variable (like $PASSWORD1) is
    also dangerous because of the 'ps auxwwwwe' command. So, saving the
    password in a well protected file (600 or rw-------) is the best
    solution.

    imasync is not protected against sniffers on the network so the
    passwords are in plain text.

EXIT STATUS
    imapsync will exit with a 0 status (return code) if everything went
    good. Otherwise, it exits with a non-zero status.

    So if you have a buggy internet connection, you can use this loop in a
    Bourne shell:

            while ! imapsync ...; do 
                  echo imapsync not complete
            done

BUGS
    No known serious bug.

    Flags : with some IMAP servers the flags are not very well copied the
    first time. Run imapsync twice if you want the flags set correctly.

HUGE MIGRATION
    If you have many mailboxes to migrate think about a little shell
    program. Write a file called file.csv (for example) containing users and
    passwords. The separator used in this example is ';'

    The file.csv file content is :

    user0001;password0001;user0002;password0002
    user0011;password0011;user0012;password0012 ...

    And the shell program is just :

    { while IFS=';' read u1 p1 u2 p2; do imapsync --user1 $u1 --password1
    $p1 --user2 $u2 --password2 $p2 ... done ; } < file.csv

    Welcome in shell programming !
