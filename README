DESCRIPTION
    The command imapsync is a tool allowing incremental and recursive imap
    transfer from one mailbox to another.

    We sometimes need to transfer mailboxes from one imap server to another.
    This is called migration.

    imapsync is the adequate tool because it reduces the amount of data
    transferred by not transferring a given message if it is already on both
    sides. Same headers, same message size and the transfer is done only
    once. All flags are preserved, unread will stay unread, read will stay
    read, deleted will stay deleted. You can stop the transfer at any time
    and restart it later, imapsync is adapted to a bad connection.

    You can decide to delete the messages from the source mailbox after a
    successful transfer (it is a good feature when migrating). In that case,
    use the --delete --expunge1 options.

    You can also just synchronize a mailbox A from another mailbox B in case
    you just want to keep a "live" copy of B in A.

OPTIONS
    Invoke: imapsync --help

HISTORY
    I wrote imapsync because an enterprise (basystemes) paid me to install a
    new imap server without loosing huge old mailboxes located on a far away
    remote imap server accessible by a low bandwith link. The tool imapcp
    (written in python) could not help me because I had to verify every
    mailbox was well transferred and delete it after a good transfer.
    imapsync started its life being a copy_folder.pl patch. The tool
    copy_folder.pl comes from the Mail-IMAPClient-2.1.3 perl module tarball
    source (in the examples/ directory of the tarball).

EXAMPLE
    While working on imapsync parameters please run imapsync in dry mode (no
    modification induced) with the --dry option. Nothing bad can be done
    this way.

    To synchronize the imap account "buddy" on host "imap.src.fr" to the
    imap account "max" on host "imap.dest.fr" (the passwords are located in
    two files "/etc/secret1" for "buddy", "/etc/secret2" for "max") :

     imapsync --host1 imap.src.fr  --user1 buddy --passfile1 /etc/secret1 \
              --host2 imap.dest.fr --user2 max   --passfile2 /etc/secret2

    Then, you will have buddy's mailbox updated from max's mailbox.

SECURITY
    You can use --password1 instead of --passfile1 to give the password but
    it is dangerous because any user on your host can see the password by
    using the 'ps auxwwww' command. Using a variable (like $PASSWORD1) is
    also dangerous because of the 'ps auxwwwwe' command. So, saving the
    password in a well protected file (600 or rw-------) is the best
    solution.

    imasync is not totally protected against sniffers on the network since
    passwords may be transferred in plain text in case CRAM-MD5 is not
    supported by your imap servers. Use --ssl1 and --ssl2 to enable
    encryption on host1 and host2.

    You may authenticate as one user (typically an admin user), but be
    authorized as someone else, which means you don't need to know every
    user's personal password. Specify --authuser1 "adminuser" to enable this
    on host1. In this case, --authmech1 PLAIN will be used, but otherwise,
    --authmech1 CRAM-MD5 is the default. Same behavior with the --authuser2
    option.

EXIT STATUS
    imapsync will exit with a 0 status (return code) if everything went
    good. Otherwise, it exits with a non-zero status.

    So if you have a buggy internet connection, you can use this loop in a
    Bourne shell:

            while ! imapsync ...; do 
                  echo imapsync not complete
            done

    Feedback good or bad is always welcome. The first you send me an email
    you will receive a confirmation request before I really read your
    message.

    The newsgroup comp.mail.imap is a good place to talk about imapsync. I
    read it when imapsync is concerned.

BUGS
    No known serious bug. Report any bug to the author. Before reporting
    bugs, read the FAQ, this README and the TODO files.

    In your report, please include:

     - imapsync version.
     - IMAPClient.pm version.
     - perl version.
     - operating system running imapsync.
     - imap servers softwares on both side and their version.

     Those values can be found with the command line

     imapsync --host1 imap.host1.net  --host2 imap.host2.org  --justconnect

     And also, if it can help :

     - operating systems on both sides.
     - imapsync with all the options you use,  the full command line
       you use (except the passwords of course)
     - output given with --debug --debugimap near the failure point.

    Please report to the author any success or bad story with imapsync and
    don't forget to mention the IMAP server software names and version on
    both sides. This will help future users. To help the author maintaining
    this section report the two lines at the begining of the output if they
    are useful to know the softwares. Example:

     From software :* OK louloutte Cyrus IMAP4 v1.5.19 server ready
     To   software :* OK Courier-IMAP ready

    You can use option --justconnect to get those lines. Example :

      imapsync --host1 imap.troc.org --host2 imap.trac.org --justconnect

    And please rate imapsync at http://freshmeat.net/projects/imapsync/

HUGE MIGRATION
    Have a special attention on options --subscribed --subscribe --delete
    --delete2 --expunge --expunge1 --expunge2 --maxage --minage --maxsize
    --useheader

    If you have many mailboxes to migrate think about a little shell
    program. Write a file called file.csv (for example) containing users and
    passwords. The separator used in this example is ';'

    The file.csv file content is :

    user0001;password0001;user0002;password0002
    user0011;password0011;user0012;password0012 ...

    And the shell program is just :

     { while IFS=';' read  u1 p1 u2 p2; do 
            imapsync --user1 "$u1" --password1 "$p1" --user2 "$u2" --password2 "$p2" ...
     done ; } < file.csv

    Welcome in shell programming !
