Bug fixes:
- Turned on --syncinternaldates option by default.
- Set timezone TZ=GMT if no timezone is set (MSWindows bug).
- Ignore message when it has no header.
- Added message id in output warning when no header found.
- Removed public freshmeat annoucement access since 1.241 was not mine (no problem) and not correct (problem).
- Can run with IMAPClient_3.x.x without redefine any function (but 3.x.x is still buggy and to be avoided)
- Started unit tests.
- Many thanks to the freshmeat folk that correct my bad and poorly English !
