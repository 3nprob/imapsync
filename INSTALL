# INSTALL file for ftpsync 


GETTING
-------

http://www.linux-france.org/prj/imapsync/dist/

PREREQUISITES
-------------

You need : 
- Perl 
  try : perl -v

- Mail::IMAPClient module 
  try : perl -mMail::IMAPClient -e ''


INSTALLING
----------
To see what will be done, just run:

make -n install

To install imapsync, just run:

make install

or copy the file imapsync where you want it to be.

TESTING
-------

You need a running imap server on localhost with two accounts
toto@est.belle with a password located in the file /var/tmp/secret1
titi@est.belle with a password located in the file /var/tmp/secret2

Of course, you can change the file tests.sh and run the tests with :

sh tests.sh

The tests.sh script break on first failure ("set -e" directive).

Since I added more tests you also need a remote imap server see the
file tests.sh and help yourself. No time to make a universal test
file.
