May be I won't since we can use comp.mail.imap
http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.mail.imap

DONE. Add a --recurse option when --folder option is used.
No I won't since this feature can be done by doing a

Yes done with --folderrec

any posted question about imapsync posted  to any group
followed by google.

not a auth connection like it is now.

DONE. Add --prefix1 option. Don't know what is the need exactly.
The need is to remove this prefix when building target folder names.
