TODO file for imapsync
----------------------


Add debian packaging in the Makefile.
Write to the debian maintener about that.

Interface with external software like procmail 

Look at http://barnson.org/node/81

Add in doc:
> The problem seems to be that one of the imap servers (the destination
> one) only supports connections over TLS, and refuses logins via plain tcp.
> Does imapsync support IMAP over TLS (IMAPS)?

Not natively. 
but, 2 ways, at least :

a) There are patches in patches/ directory to do this 
   in imapsync code.
   I tried to include them but it broke my tests.
   It works but not always.

b) Use stunnel
   http://www.stunnel.org/
   Assuming there is an imaps (993) server on imap.foo.org,
   on your localhost machine (or bar machine) run :
       stunnel -c -d imap -r imap.foo.org:imaps
   or
       stunnel -c -d 143 -r imap.foo.org:993
   then use imapsync on localhost (or bar machine) imap (143) port.

Talk about :
"I think notes is right but MS Eudora is bad with dates.
(netscape or thunderbird is ok with dates)
use the option --syncinternaldates "


Add usage about --regextrans2
To remove INBOX. in the name of destination folders :
--regextrans2 's/^INBOX\.(.+)/$1/'
