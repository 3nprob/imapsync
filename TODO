TODO file for imapsync

Talk about mbox and maildir format when "Invalid header"

Post on newsgroup comp.mail.imap when a new release comes.
http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.mail.imap

Add my amazon wishlist link.

Add an --exactsync option to remove target messages
that are not on source. Maybe --delete2 is a better name.

Read the IMAP RFC http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3501.html

Add debian packaging in the Makefile.
Write to the debian maintener about that.

Interface with external software like procmail

Explain expunge behavior.

DONE. Fix the "word too large" or "Command line too long"
      bug with some imap servers.

DONE. Add features from Herman (patch against 1.139 and
again with 1.156 by Kjetil Torgrim Homme)
 - Support for authenticating as different (admin) user

DONE. Look at http://freshmeat.net/projects/freshmeat-submit/

DONE in FAQ.Talk about :
"I think notes is right but MS Eudora is bad with dates.
(netscape or thunderbird is ok with dates)
use the option --syncinternaldates "

DONE. Create a imapsync mailing list.
May be I won't since we can use comp.mail.imap
http://groups.google.fr/group/comp.mail.imap
to talk about imapsync

DONE. Add a --recurse option when --folder option is used.
No I won't since this feature can be done by doing a 
--include '^INBOX.MyFolder'

Done. Look at comp.mail.imap http://groups.google.fr/groups?q=imapsync
In fact I set up an google alert on imapsync so I read
any posted question about imapsync posted  to any group
followed by google.

DONE. Add usage about --regextrans2
To remove INBOX. in the name of destination folders:
--regextrans2 's/^INBOX\.(.+)/$1/'
To sync a complete account in a subfolder called FOO:
--regextrans2 's/^INBOX(.*)/INBOX.FOO$1/'

DONE. Make the --justconnect a real "just connect" connection,
not a auth connection like it is now.

DONE. Add --prefix1 option. Don't know what is the need exactly.
The need is to remove this prefix when building target folder names.

DONE. Read the IMAP RFC http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2342.txt
Respect the NAMESPACE behavior like the RFC.

DONE. Add in doc: Does imapsync support IMAP over TLS (IMAPS)?

DONE. Add the licence of each IMAP software (the free ones).

Javier Gomez succeed. He failed.
MailEnable is an early stage developpment IMAP server.

DONE. Think about speed.

DONE. Pb if "to separator" is in "from folder" name.
Have to choose a caracter != to separator and
not in from folders. The solution can be to
just exchange the two separator caracters.

DONE. Look at the separator() function in Mail::IMAPClient

DONE. Add SASL support MD5 : DIGEST-MD5 and CRAM-MD5
