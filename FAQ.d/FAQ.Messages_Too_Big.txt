              Dealing with too big messages with Imapsync.
=======================================================================

Questions answered in this FAQ are:

Q. What does imapsync with big messages?

Q. What can I do to transfer messages bigger than what allows the 
   imap destination server?

Now the questions again with their answers.

=======================================================================
Q. What does imapsync with big messages?

R. By default, imapsync checks if the host2 imap server announces a
message size limit with "APPENDLIMIT=xxxx" in its CAPABILITY response.
Then imapsync takes this value to set automatically the --maxsize
option, unless --maxsize is already set on the command line and has a
smaller value than the APPENDLIMIT value.
   
If the host2 imap server doesn't announce any message size limit then
imapsync syncs all messages no matter their sizes.
   
When a message is copied to the destination server, the destination
server accepts it or not but it does it as a whole, it takes the full
message or nothing. Nothing triggers an error in imapsync.

   * Gmail announces APPENDLIMIT=35651584 (June 2021).
   * Office365 announces nothing.
   * Dovecot announces nothing.
   * Usually imap servers announce nothing.

Q. What can I do to transfer messages bigger than what allows the 
   imap destination server?

R1. A solution is to truncate the message to the maximum size allowed
before copying it to host2. That's a little dirty but it's ok if you
prefer having a truncated message than no message at all. The
attachments after the truncation won't be available but everything
before should be ok. It may also depend on the software tool reading
the email message.

For example, Gmail currently limits messages to 35651584 bytes, 
aka 34 MiB (June 2021),

Starting with imapsync release 1.938 option --truncmess xxxx truncates
messages bigger than the given size xxxx, size given in bytes.

  imapsync --truncmess 35651584 --appendlimit 1000000000000

The --appendlimit option is only needed imap servers that offer the
APPENDLIMIT capability, for example, Gmail. Using it doesn't hurt
anyway.

Prior to imapsync release 1.938, instead of --truncmess:

On Linux, use:

   imapsync ... --pipemess  'perl -0ne "print substr \$_,0,35651584" '
   
On windows, use (I'm not sure of, not tested yet):

   imapsync ... --pipemess  "perl -0ne 'print substr $_,0,35651584' "


R2. A not-so-dirty solution would be to transform the big messages,
replace the attachments with links to the attachments stored elsewhere.
Well, it's not done and it's too much complicated compared to a simpler
solution which is to allow bigger messages on the destination account.

As time goes on, disk space is cheaper and cheaper.  Don't make the
new user account, the destination account, worst than his previous,
buy disks. Monitor and rule your resources, not the users.
