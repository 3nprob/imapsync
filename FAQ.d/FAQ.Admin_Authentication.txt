            Imapsync tips about imap admin authentication.
=======================================================================

It can be useful to authenticate without knowing each user password.
Using an admin account to authenticate is not a standard feature
supported by all imap servers. Sometimes it is implemented via --authuser1
sometimes not. It depends on the server software and its configuration.
You have to figure out what is the imap software server,
find out if it supports an admin account and how, 
if an admin account is actually configured and
finally check an authentication via this admin account for
a standard user.
